In order to append a new copyright header format for working with, it is 
necessary follow the next steps: 
  1- Add a new global variable with the path to the new copyright style 
     document:
    $COPYRIGHT_FILENAME_XML_STYLE = "resources/copyright_xml_style.txt";
  2- Get the number of characters of the file
    $COPYRIGHT_LENGTH_XML_STYLE = chars_per_file($COPYRIGHT_FILENAME_XML_STYLE);
  3- Get the number of bytes of the copyright header file in order to seek into 
     the file
    $COPYRIGHT_SIZE_XML_STYLE = -s $COPYRIGHT_FILENAME_XML_STYLE;
  4- Load the copyright text in a variable
    $COPYRIGHT_TEXT_XML_STYLE = read_text_w_length(
                $COPYRIGHT_FILENAME_XML_STYLE, $COPYRIGHT_LENGTH_XML_STYLE);

Once our global variables are set up, we have to add some sentences in the next 
functions: ‘check_if_copyright’, ‘copy_copyright_in_file’, 
‘delete_copyright_in_file’: 
  1- Check_if_copyright
    Add an elsif clause with the extension you want to add, positioning the file
    handler at the position you need and read the copyright from the file:
    
        elsif ($file_extension eq ".sh") {
            # We positioning our handler at the start of the file 
            seek $fh, 0, 0;
            read($fh, $copyright, $COPYRIGHT_LENGTH_SH_STYLE);
        }

  Then, check if the copyright is written and add the checking sentence:
        elsif ($file_extension eq ".sh"){
            if ($copyright eq $COPYRIGHT_TEXT_SH_STYLE) {
                $have_copyright = 1;
            }
        }
  2- copy_copyright_in_file
    In order to copy the copyright header in a file, you have to add an elsif 
    clause for the corresponding programming language. Into elsif clause, 
    positioning the file handler at the start of the file and copy the copyright
    header and the $buffer, which contains the rest of the file:

        elsif ($file_extension eq ".sh") {
            # set the file handle at the start of the file
            seek $fh, 0, 0;
            print $fh $COPYRIGHT_TEXT_SH_STYLE.$buffer;
        } 
  3- delete_copyright_in_file
    In order to delete the copyright header in a file, you have to add an elsif
    clause for the corresponding programming language. Into elsif clause, 
    the file handler is positioned after the copyright text, and copy the rest
    of the file in a new one.

        elsif ($file_extension eq ".sh") {
            # in SH type commentaries, we just delete the 
            # $COPYRIGHT_SIZE_SH_STYLE first characters 
            seek $fh, $COPYRIGHT_SIZE_SH_STYLE, 0;
            while (<$fh>) {
                my $line = $_;
                print $new_fh $line;
            }
        }
